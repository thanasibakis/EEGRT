# EEGRT

Linear modeling of trial reaction times vs. the N200 and P300 peaks in EEG data

## Code included:
- **main.R**, the primary script to model the actual data,
- **read.R**, the library needed to convert the provided Matlab matrix data to a helpful R data frame format,
- **visualize.R**, a library for plotting the EEG data with its peaks overlayed, for visual analysis, and
- **analyze.R**, the library needed for estimating the peak locations in the EEG data as features for the model
