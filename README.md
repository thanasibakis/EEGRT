# Summer Research 2019

Analyzing the relationships between reaction time and the N200 and P300 peaks in EEG data. See **Report.pdf**.

## Code included:
- **main.Rmd**, the primary report & code to model the data,
- **read.R**, the library needed to convert the provided Matlab matrix data to a helpful R data frame format,
- **visualize.R**, a library for plotting the EEG data with its peaks overlayed, for visual analysis, and
- **analyze.R**, the library needed for estimating the peak locations in the EEG data as features for the model
